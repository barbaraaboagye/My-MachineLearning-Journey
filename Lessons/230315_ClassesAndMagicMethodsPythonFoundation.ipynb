    "### Magic methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Magic methods in Python are special methods that start and end with double underscores (also known as \"dunder\" methods), such as __init__, __str__, __len__, and many others. These methods are called automatically by the Python interpreter in response to certain operations or events, such as object instantiation, arithmetic operations, attribute access, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of magic methods is to allow classes to define their own behavior for certain language constructs or operations, making it easier to customize and extend their functionality. For example, the __init__ method is called when an object is created and can be used to initialize its attributes, while the __str__ method is called when the str function is used to convert an object to a string, and can be used to provide a human-readable representation of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of magic methods and their purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __init__(self, ...) is called when an object is created and can be used to initialize its attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __str__(self) is called when the str function is used to convert an object to a string and can be used to provide a human-readable representation of the object.\n",
    "- __len__(self) is called when the len function is used to get the length of an object, and can be used to return the number of elements in the object.\n",
    "- __add__(self, other) is called when the + operator is used to add two objects together, and can be used to define custom behavior for this operation.\n",
    "- __getattr__(self, name) is called when an attribute is accessed that doesn't exist, and can be used to provide custom behavior for attribute access.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing these and other magic methods in your own classes, you can make your code more powerful and expressive, and more closely match the behavior of built-in Python types.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE : <BR>\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, self is a reference to the instance of the class that the method is being called on. It is the first parameter of all instance methods, including magic methods, and is used to access the attributes and methods of the instance. It should always be included as the first parameter of these methods. When a magic method is called on an instance of the class, Python automatically passes a reference to the instance as the self parameter, so you don't need to pass it explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the __init__ method, self refers to the newly created instance of the class, and is used to set its attributes.  "
