    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming that allows you to define a new class based on an existing class. The new class is called the \"subclass\" or \"derived class\", and it inherits all the attributes and methods of the existing class, called the \"base class\" or \"superclass\". The subclass can then add new attributes and methods or override existing ones as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance provides a way to reuse code and avoid duplication. Instead of creating a new class from scratch, you can start with an existing class and modify it as needed to create a new class that shares some or all of the characteristics of the original class.\n",
