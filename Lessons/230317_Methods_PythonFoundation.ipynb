    "### Class Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "A class method is a type of method that is defined on the class itself, rather than on an instance of the class. It can be called on the class itself, rather than on an instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key features of class methods is that they have access to the class-level variables and attributes. This can be useful if you want to create a method that applies to the class as a whole, rather than to individual instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can define a class method by using the @classmethod decorator before the method definition. The first argument to a class method is conventionally named cls (short for \"class\"), and it refers to the class itself rather than an instance of the class. Class methods are often used to create alternative constructors for a class, or to perform operations that apply to the class as a whole rather than to individual instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two important decorator methods to know about when it comes to classes: *@classmethod* and *@staticmethod*\n",
