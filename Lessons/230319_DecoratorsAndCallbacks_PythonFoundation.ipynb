    "In this example, we define two functions `add_numbers` and `multiply_numbers` that perform addition and multiplication, respectively. We also define a function called `apply_operation` that takes a function `func` and two arguments `a` and `b`, and applies the function `func` to the two arguments. We then call the `apply_operation` function twice, passing `add_numbers` and `multiply_numbers` as the func argument, and `5` and `3` as the `a` and `b` arguments. The `apply_operation` function then calls the `add_numbers` and `multiply_numbers` functions, respectively, passing `5` and `3` as the arguments, and returns the result."

    "### What's the difference between a decorator and a callback?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use a cooking analogy to explain the difference between a decorator and a callback.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `decorator` is like adding seasoning to a dish. Imagine you're cooking a simple pasta dish, but you want to make it a bit more flavorful. So, you add some salt, pepper, and garlic to the dish. These ingredients don't fundamentally change the pasta, but they enhance the flavor and make it more enjoyable to eat. Similarly, a decorator adds extra functionality to a function without changing its core functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `callback` is like a notification on your phone. You're busy doing something else, but you want to be notified when something important happens, such as receiving a message or an email. So, you set up your phone to notify you when these events occur. When they do, your phone interrupts whatever you're doing to notify you of the event. Similarly, a callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function or method, and is called at a specific point during the execution of that function or method. It notifies you of a specific event or condition during the execution of the function or method.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the main difference between a `decorator` and a `callback` is that a decorator modifies the behavior of a function from within that function, while a callback allows the calling code to modify the behavior of a function from outside that function"
