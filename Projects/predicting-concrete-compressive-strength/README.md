# Predicting concrete compressive strength


In this project, I will be learning how to predict concrete compressive strength based on data obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maajdl/yeh-concret-data). The dataset can also be found here on my github. The data contains information about congrete ingredients, age and compressive strength.

I will start with using the Random Forest model and also play around with other ML model. I will be doing this alongside my [intro to statistics course](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-statistics--st101) so I get to apply the knowledge I gain.
