The resources I am using can be found [here](https://github.com/barbaraaboagye/My-MachineLearning-Journey/blob/492e4be3db9c2480ffd21b20bd580d753da33226/MACHINE%20LEARNING%20ROADMAP.md)

## APPROACH
- Developed a learning roadmap to follow.
- Followed people who work in the machine learning space on twitter and engage and read their tweets
- Taking the [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning) from kaggle

## CHANGE OF PLANS

In March 2023 after a months break, I have decided to follow the framework/roadmap of [Made with ML](https://madewithml.com/)
- March 12 - 19 : Finished the python foundation framework
    - Functions, Methods, List,Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries, list comprehension, Decorators, Callback etc
- March 20 - 23 : Finished the numpy foundation
    - Mathematical objects of linear algebra, indexing and mathematical operations, joining tensors, transpose, etc
- March 24 -   :
