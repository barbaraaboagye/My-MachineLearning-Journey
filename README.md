## APPROACH
- Developed a learning roadmap to follow.
- Followed people who work in the machine learning space on twitter and engage and read their tweets
- Taking the [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning) from kaggle

## CHANGE OF PLANS

In March 2023 after a months break, I have decided to follow the framework/roadmap of [Made with ML](https://madewithml.com/)
- March 12 - 19 : Finished the python foundation framework
    - Functions, Methods, List,Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries, list comprehension, Decorators, Callback etc
- March 20 - 23 : Finished the numpy foundation
    - Mathematical objects of linear algebra, indexing and mathematical operations, joining tensors, transpose, etc
- March 24 - 27  : Finished Pandas foundation
    - creating dataframes, exploratory data analysis (.describe(), .hist(), .corr()), pre-processing (.dropna(),.drop(),.reset_index()), filtering,indexing,grouping,saving, etc.
- March 28 - April 3 : Finished PyTorch foundation <br>
    - creating tensor, operations on tensors, indexing, slicing, joining,gradients, etc <br>
PS: I had a hard time installing `torch`on my mac ðŸ˜­ or better said using torch on vscode maybe?. Once i installed the torch on conda, I had to change the kernel to Pytorch. I missed two study session, trying to figure this out. But I figured it out. Better late than never.
    
## BREAK: April 6 to May 1st 

I am taking a pause on this from April 6 to May 1st. I have other pressing commitments I have to work on in April (ee).

## LIFE HAPPENED : Aug 27

I am back again. Started learning through projects 
- Resume scanner : I finished this. The scanner takes a CV and builds a word cloud. It also can take a job description and use the `similarity function` to determine whether you are well suited for the job.

## SCHOLARSHIP DATABASE RECOMMENDER : Sep 4 to Sep 16 

I cleaned the database from the scholarship database and created a Python based scholarship database, where a user enters the program of interest and a list of scholarships or likely schools are suggested. 

## WEB SCRAPING : Sep 18 to

- Sep 25: This is hard. I am currently just watching videos. I tried to scrape data off Twitter but it looks like the API is currently not working. I want to use this knowledge or skill to get scholarship data from universities or scholarship sites. Let's see how it goes. I haven't written any codes yet. Just watching videos at the moment.
- Sep 26 : How to use Find and Find_All to find information from a website
- Sep 27 : Started with trying to extract the table data in the scholarship database
